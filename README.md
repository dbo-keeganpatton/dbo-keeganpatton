## Hi! I'm Keegan..

### Who am I?
I am a [Senior Data Analyst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keeganpatton/) working with a major retailer solving real-world problems at enterprise scale. My passions lie in the more technical aspects of my work often veering towards data engineering. In my personal pursuits I spend most of my time writing Python for data-centric projects, Next.JS/React for web development, and Go for some fun on the side! Check out my [Personal Site](https://www.keeganpatton.dev/) where I showcase projects that I work on.

However at my core I am a life-long skateboarder, and I often find parallels between that practice and other pursuits that I focus on. Feel free to [reach out to me](https://www.keeganpatton.dev/contact) so we can nerd out together!
