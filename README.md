## Hi! I'm Keegan..

### Who am I?
I am a [Senior Data Analyst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keeganpatton/) working with a major retailer solving real-world problems at enterprise scale. I love finding myself in challenging work and believe that working through states of ambiguity and a willingness to fail fast and iterate leads to the greatest results. My passions lie in the more technical aspects of my work often veering towards application development and data engineering. In my personal pursuits I spend most of my time writing Python for data-centric projects, Next.JS/React for web development, and Go for some fun on the side! Check out my [Personal Site](https://www.keeganpatton.dev/) where I showcase projects that I work on.

However at my core I am a life-long skateboarder, and I often find parallels between that practice and other pursuits that I focus on. Feel free to [reach out to me](https://www.keeganpatton.dev/contact) so we can nerd out together!
