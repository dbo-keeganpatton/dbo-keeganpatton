## Hi! I'm Keegan..

### Who am I?
I'm a [Data Analyst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keeganpatton/) who loves to solve problems and tinker with data engineering and application design. I spend most of my time writing Python for data-centric projects, Next.JS/React for web development, and Go for some fun on the side! Check out my [Personal Site](https://www.keeganpatton.dev/) where I showcase projects that I work on.

I am a life-long skateboarder, and apply the same approach to coding as I do skating! Feel free to [reach out to me](https://www.keeganpatton.dev/contact) anytime!
