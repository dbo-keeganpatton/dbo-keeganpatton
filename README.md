## Hi! I'm Keegan..

### What do I do?
I am a Senior Data Analyst who works for a major retailer solving real-world problems at enterprise scale. I love finding myself in challenging work and I often find that working through states of ambiguity and a willingness to fail fast and iterate leads to the greatest results. 

### Who am I?
My passions lie in the more technical aspects of my work often veering towards application development and data engineering. In my personal pursuits I spend most of my time writing Python for data-centric projects, Next.JS/React for web development, and Go for some fun on the side!

However at my core I am a life-long skateboarder, and I often find parallels between that practice and other pursuits that I focus on.
